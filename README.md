# OSPO Discussions

![Octocats Collaborating](https://octodex.github.com/images/collabocats.jpg)

## Introduction

This is a public repository for discussions relating to Open Source Program Offices on GitHub. We hope to build a welcoming space where helpful conversations about tools, policies, and other topics can flourish.

## Discussion forums

The main purpose for this repo is to host the [Discussion forums](https://github.com/community/OSPO/discussions). The docs for GitHub Discussions are [available here](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions). 

## Private discussion membership

Similar to the [todogroup forums](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology), we have both a public, open discussion forum (here) as well as a private, invite-only forum for high-trust discussions under Chatham House Rule, meaning

> ... Participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed.

To request access to the private forum for yourself or additional members of your organization, please [file an issue](https://github.com/community/OSPO/issues/new) mentioning their GitHub handles.

## Code of Conduct

Discussions here are subject to the GitHub community [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/community/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
